# Thump - a Wire Witch Games Production
A game started for October 2018's #devtober. My first major game project from start to (hopeful) end. "Thump" (working title) is intended to be a story and exploration game based on my personal experiences with an anxiety disorder, how that effects my perception of the world and my relationships in it.

Continued updates on the game's production will be shared on our #dev twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/WireWitchGames"> @WireWitchGames</a>. Thanks!
